#+TITLE: Emacs Config

* Foreword

I started using Emacs long ago. As usually it is, everything began with having a
single =~/.emacs= file and pasting into it some random code snippets found
across the web.

After discovering some bulky plugins the =~/.emacs.d= was discovered and
separate plugin files and directories moved there. But the glue code grew, some
own functions were developed, and managing a single =~/.emacs= became awkward.

Even after splitting the initialization code into separete modules, it was still
a long time having the =~/.emacs.d= in dropbox shared across multiple
workstations and containing all the necessary plugins cherry-picked from the
net.

The major problem was the unmaintainability of these plugin
versions. Approximately at this time the =package.el= grew its popularity and
the whole stuff started looking promising. Another reason to move towards
network-based package deployment was my wish to switch from the dropbox solution
to github because at my new working place firewall didn't allow dropbox
access: Having all the third-party plugins in git looked a bit unwieldy.

The tipping point came when I discovered an amazing
[[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][Oh My Emacs]]. It proved the concept
of maintaining an extremely elaborate Emacs configuration in a transparent and
manageable way. And though I prefer to keep my config looking like code and not
like the document (still, I am totally a fan of the =org-mode=), the =ome= has
heavily influenced the current state of things.


* Installation

Currently, neither the =~/.emacs= file, nor =~/.emacs.d= are not replaced by the
config. The idea behind that is to keep the configuration sources as far as
possible from automatic updates from the Emacs and its plugins side.

All the artifacts created by different emacs modes (i.e. =recentf= history) are
encouraged to be stored in =~/.emacs.d=, all the user-specific settings (like
=custom-set-variables= stuff set by emacs configuration tool) are encouraged to
stay in the =~/.emacs=.

Anyways, there is always a possibility to experiment with =user-emacs-directory=
and with =custom-file=.

To start using the =ecfg=, clone the repo into =~/.emacs.config= or anywhere you
find more appropriate.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/maslennikov/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.config
#+END_SRC

To load the =ecfg= during the Emacs start-up, put as a first line into your
=~/.emacs= the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.config/init.el")
#+END_SRC

It can take a few minutes, all depending on your internet connection speed, for
the initial start-up to download and set all the required packages.


* How it works

The entry point to the =ecfg= is the =init.el= file. It takes care of the
correct load order of the rest modules.

Configuration files are located in two directories:
- =init.d=: contains core emacs configuration, universally applied to all emacs
  activities;
- =modules=: contains configuration relevand for particular contexts (e.g. major
  mode set-ups).

Every of this files is called a "module" in terms of =ecfg=. For each module, a
init function with a special name can be defined: =ecfg-NAME-module-init=, where
the module's name is acquired from its filename of the format
=ecfg-NAME.el=. After loading the module, its init function will be called, if
present.

Core configuration from the =init.d= is loaded immediately during the emacs
startup, therefore a careful analysis of potential performance implications is
required when modifying these files. Please refer to [[Package Installation
Policy]].

Configuration from the =modules= directory is handled with the autoloads
facility. During the first run, the autoloads for the whole directory will be
generated (see =ecfg-user-dir=) and will be used in the subsequent runs. It is
recommended to have the module's init function autoloaded and to register this
function as a hook in =auto-mode-alist= via the helper macro =ecfg-auto-module=.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;###autoload (ecfg-auto-module "CMakeLists\\.txt$" cmake)
#+END_SRC

In this case, the whole module will be forced to be loaded only when a file with
the corresponding pattern is opened.


** El-Get

All third-party packages are installed via [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][=el-get=]], therefore it is
bootstrapped as the first step. Instead of using =el-get= directly, the
=ecfg-install= macro should be used.

The standard =el-get= behavior is restricted for performance reasons to just
downloading the packages and adding their directories to the
=load-path=. Automatic autoloads management is disabled, package init hooks are
passed dynamically via the =ecfg-install= macro; in case when autoloads should
be generated and loaded for the whole package (normally, when a manual
=autoload= invocation in the init hook is not convenient to use), the
=ecfg-with-local-updates=.

To override the =el-get= recipes, store the fixed recipe file in
=el-get-recipes=.


* Package installation policy

The new package installacion should be accompanied by the following reasoning:

1. Does the package belong to the core configuration (will go into =init.d=) or
   it is relevant only to the specific context (=modules=)?
2. Is there anything in =el-get= recipe that will cause an immediate loading of
   the package (e.g. =:features= or specific =:prepare= code)? If yes, override
   the recipe with the local copy.
3. What event will trigger the package load? For instance, if it is always the
   invocation of a single command (e.g. via s shortcut), then it'll make sense
   to write a single =(autoload ...)= statement in the init hook of your
   =ecfg-install=. If there are multiple entry points to the package (like with
   =helm=), id would be sensible to read =loaddefs= for the whole package during
   the init. The usage of package-isolated autoloads is facilitated by
   =ecfg-with-local-autoloads= macro.



* Known issues

While experimenting with =el-get=, =el-get-bundle=, and recipes, be sure to
remember about the cached stuff:
- =el-get/bundle-init/=: contains passed to =el-get-bundle= init code;
- =el-get/.status=: contains cached recipes for all installed packages;
- =el-get/.loaddefs.el=: contains autoloads from all installed packages - can be
  large. See also =el-get-use-autoloads= customizable variable.
